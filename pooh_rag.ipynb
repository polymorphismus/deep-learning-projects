    "This project shows that when the generation model stays the same, retrieval strategy becomes the key factor in RAG performance. Using simple similarity search with small fixed-size chunks gives only moderate accuracy (64–68%). When switching to separator-based semantic chunking, accuracy jumps to 84–88%, most previous NOT FOUND cases disappear, and the system becomes much more reliable at retrieving multi-sentence facts."
